# The Blendinator

This project was made for the `Research and Development: Embedded` course of the master in engineering technology at GroupT KUL. The Blendinator is a digital mixing desk which is able to mix an analog input together with a Bluetooth input. It also features several audio effects such as echo, equalizer, volume control, etc. The full audio pipeline is implemented in VHDL and deployed on the FPGA fabric of a Xilinx device. Bluetooth connection, pipeline control and the Graphical user interface are implemented on the SoC. Details about the implementation can be found below.
