# Qt application for user interaction

This project includes the development of a Qt application that enables users to interact with the mixing table. The application features custom widgets, each dedicated to specific functionalities such as connecting to a Bluetooth device or managing and monitoring audio effects. To organize these functionalities, we will utilize `QTabWidget`, providing a clear and intuitive tabbed interface for seamless navigation. 

The implementation details of the code will not be covered in this documentation, but the complete source code can be found in the GitLab repository associated with this project.
