# MATLAB

In our digital mixer, we want to utilize various types of filters to control parameters such as the volume of specific frequency bands or to cut off part of the frequency spectrum. To create these filters, we used MATLAB, Simulink and the HDL Coder from MATLAB to generate VHDL code as a foundation for further development.

## Low & High Pass Filter

As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, we want to able to cut off part of the frequency spectrum from the input sources of our digital mixer. To achieve this, we will employ both low-pass and high-pass filters.

In Simulink, we designed an 8th order low-pass & high-pass filter by using a Cascade of four Direct Form 2 Digital Biquad Filters.

The Simulink files for the low-pass & high-pass Filters can be found in the Git Repo.

A biquad filter is a second order filter containing two poles and two zeros. In the Z-domain, the transfer function for this type of filter is the ratio of two quadratic functions:

$$ H(z)=\frac{b_0+b_1z^{-1}+b_2z^{-2}}{a_0+a_1z^{-1}+a_2z^{-2}} $$

The filter coefficients are often normalized so that $a_0 = 1$, which is also the case in the Python library we use to generate these coefficients. The updated transfer function, shown below, is the same as the one implemented in Simulink, as illustrated in the image above:

$$ H(z)=\frac{b_0+b_1z^{-1}+b_2z^{-2}}{1+a_1z^{-1}+a_2z^{-2}} $$

We are using a Python library called [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/index.html) to generate the coëfficients for these filters. To be able to work with SciPy, we need to install the following package:
```bash
pip3 install scipy
```

This is the script to get the coëfficients for the low-pass filter:
```python
from scipy import signal
from scipy.signal import sos2tf

N = 8 # filter order
wn = 3000/(48000/2) # natural frequency between 0 and 1
sos = signal.iirfilter(N, wn, btype='lowpass', output = 'sos', ftype='butter')

print(sos)
```
You can use the same code for generating the coëfficients for the high-pass filter by changing **btype** to **highpass**.

To estimate the time required to generate these coefficients, we created a simple script that generates coefficients for a thousand low-pass filters with varying cut-off frequencies.

```python
from scipy import signal
import time
import numpy as np

N = 8  # filter order

execution_times = []

for i in range(1000):
    start_time = time.time()
    
    wn = 3*(i+1) / (48000 / 2)  # natural frequency between 0 and 1
    sos = signal.iirfilter(N, wn, btype='lowpass', output='sos', ftype='butter')
    
    end_time = time.time()
    execution_times.append(end_time - start_time)

# Calculate statistics
average_time = np.mean(execution_times)
min_time = np.min(execution_times)
max_time = np.max(execution_times)

print(average_time*1000)
print(min_time*1000)
print(max_time*1000)
```

Here are the results obtained from running the script:

* Average execution time: 0.88 milliseconds
* Minimum execution time: 0.74 milliseconds
* Maximum execution time: 1.78 milliseconds

!!! info

    The filter coefficients generated by this Python script are too small when implementing an 8th-order Low or High Pass filter, leading to significant errors during conversion to fixed-point representation with 23-bit precision. Therefore, we decided to use a 2nd-order Low Pass filter and a 4th-order High Pass filter instead.

## Shelving Filters

Our goal is to control the gain of the low, mid, and high-frequency ranges of the input sources. To achieve this, we aim to design a filter capable of amplifying or attenuating the gain in the low (<200 Hz), mid (200 Hz to <2 kHz), and high (≥2 kHz) frequency bands. The filter type we've selected for this purpose is the shelving filter. Shelving filters are particularly well-suited for this task, as they allow for precise gain adjustments within a specific frequency band while leaving the rest of the frequency spectrum unaffected.

We have reviewed several research papers on designing these filters digitally and have selected [this](https://www.eurasip.org/Proceedings/Eusipco/Eusipco2006/papers/1568980789.pdf) particular paper as our primary source of information.

### Low Shelf

Following is a brief summary of all the variables, and their meanings, that you need to know to calculate the coëfficients for the Low Shelf version of these type of filters.

$$ \alpha_m=\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{2m-1}{2M}\right)\pi $$

$$ c_m=\cos(a_m) $$

$$ V=\sqrt[M]{g}-1 $$

$$ K=\tan\left(\frac{\Omega_B}{2}\right) $$

* M is the filter order
* m is the m-th second order section of the filter
* $a_m$ is the angle of the pole and zero of the m-th section
* g is the amplification/attenuation of the filter in V/V
* $\Omega_B$ is the filter bandwidth in **radians** per sample

$\Omega_B$ can be calculated usting the following formula:
$$ \Omega_B = \frac{f_{band}}{f_{\frac{s}{2}}}\pi$$

We are using the same biquad filters to implement the shelving filters. The transfer function given in the paper cannot be directly mapped to the $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_0$, $b_1$ and $a_2$ variables. After some calculation, this is the result:

$$ a_0 = K^2 + 2K\cdot c_m + 1 $$

$$ a_1 = 2K^2-2 $$

$$ a_2 = K^2 - 2K\cdot c_m + 1 $$

$$ b_0 = K^2(V^2+2V+1) + 2K\cdot c_m(V+1) +1 $$

$$ b_1 = 2K^2(V^2+2V+1)-2 $$

$$ b_0 = K^2(V^2+2V+1) - 2K\cdot c_m(V+1) +1 $$

### High Shelf

To calculate the High Shelf filter, follow the same procedure as for the Low Shelf filter. However, to achieve a High Shelf response, you need to negate the $a_1$ and $b_1$ coefficients.

### Band Shelf

To create a Band Shelf filter, the input signal is first amplified or attenuated to the desired gain. Then, a Low Shelf filter is cascaded with a High Shelf filter to amplify or attenuate the low ans high frequency bands, matching it to the level of the original input signal.

### MATLAB Simulations
We did some MATLAB Simulations to verify whether the shelving filters work as intended.

<img src="/img/shelving_filter.png"/>
 
The image above illustrates, from left to right: a Low Shelf filter with a gain of -10dB and a bandwidth of 300Hz, a Band Shelf filter with a gain of -26dB and a bandwidth of 6kHz, and a High Shelf filter with a gain of +5dB and a bandwidth of 18kHz.

## Simulink

We used the same Direct Form 2 Digital Biquad Filter in Simulink to test out the shelving filters. However, this fitler overflowed almost instantly. This is actually a disadvantage of the Direct Form 2 stucture, it can cause numbers to get too large to handle (arithmetic overflow) when using a certain combination of filter coëfficients.

So, we switched to the Direct Form 1 Digital Biquad Filter as shown in the image below.

<img src="/img/direct_form_1_digital_biquad_filter.png"/>


!!! info

    Because of the overflow issue, we also switched the Low and High pass filter to the Direct Form 1 Digital Biquad Filter structure. This ensures that all the filters we develop share the same structure, allowing us to implement a single, unified filter design in VHDL.

Instead of calculating the filter coëfficients beforehand, we also added the formulas for calculating the coëfficients in Simulink.

<img src="/img/shelving_filter_coefficients.png"/>

This was the result of simuling the Low Shelf filter with a bandwidth of 400Hz and a gain of +5dB when passing a sine wave of 100Hz and 400Hs through the filter.

<img src="/img/low_shelf_100.png"/>

<img src="/img/low_shelf_400.png"/>

We can conclude that this filter works as intended, as it amplifies the sine at 100Hz and doesn't change the sine wave at 400Hz.
